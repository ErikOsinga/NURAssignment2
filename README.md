# NURAssignment2
My solutions to NUR assignment 2. 



git clone the repository and then run everything with a single call "./run.sh" (or "bash run.sh") that generates the outputs and a PDF with the code/comments and figures. The PDF file that is generated is called "main.pdf". Four movies are also made, "quest4c.mp4", "quest4dxy.mp4", "quest4dxz.mp4" and "quest4dyz.mp4".
